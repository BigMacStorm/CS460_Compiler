1. Open directory
2. "make clean"
3. "make"
4. "./compiler [-d lsp] program.c < program.c"

Where "program" is the name of the program to run the compiler on.

Testcase programs are in the same directory, and are named
    "test1.c" ... "test6.c".

An output file of the same name but with extension ".list" will be created when the compiler is run on a ".c" program. These are the list files, where lines of source code and reductions are output.

A file called "log.txt" will be created when the "-d l", "-d s", or "-d p" options are used.(or any combination, such as "-d ls" or "-d lsp")

A file called "llog.txt" will be created. This is the token file, where all of the tokens are dumped from lex.
