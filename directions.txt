1. Open directory
2. "make clean"
3. "make"
4. "./compiler [-d lsp] program.c < program.c"

Where "program" is the name of the program to run the compiler on.

Testcase programs are in the same directory, and are named
    "test1.c" ... "test6.c".

An output file of the same name but with extension ".list" will be created when the compiler is run on a ".c" program. These are the list files, where lines of source code and reductions are output by the parser.

A file called "llog.txt" will be created when the "-d l" option is used. This is the token file, where all of the tokens are dumped from lex.

A file called "symTableLog.txt" will be created when the "-d s" option is used and there are occurrences of //!!S inside of the program. These will cause symbol table dumps to be written to the file.

A file called "log.txt" will be created when the "-d l", "-d s", or "-d p" options are used.(or any combination, such as "-d ls" or "-d lsp") containing all debug information.
